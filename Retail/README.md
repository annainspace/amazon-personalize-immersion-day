## Introduction

Welcome to the Retail Demo Store! As a developer here at the Retail Demo Store it is your mission to delight your customers by helping them discover the best products available on the site with personalized recommendations just for them.

You've been asked by the founders to:

* increase user engagement by tailoring every experience to individual users.
* help users discover newly released items
* increase the breadth of items offered to them from the Retail Demo Store catalog
* reduce the time to value by creating valuable recommendations in a short time
* the Retail Demo Store prides itself on being data driven, so you will need to develop a system that will support experimentation with new personalized experiences, so you can be sure the experiences you are creating improve user engagement.

In this workshop, we will add personalized recommendations to the Retail Demo Store website. The workshop is split into the following sections:
