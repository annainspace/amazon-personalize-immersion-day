    "In Amazon Personalize, you start by creating a dataset group, which is a container for Amazon Personalize components. Your dataset group can be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Domain dataset group, where you create preconfigured resources for different business domains and use cases, such as getting recommendations for similar videos (VIDEO_ON_DEMAND domain) or best selling items (ECOMMERCE domain). You choose your business domain, import your data, and create Recommenders. You use Recommenders in your application to get recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a [Domain dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/domain-dataset-groups.html) if you have a video on demand or e-commerce application and want Amazon Personalize to find the best configurations for your use cases. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can also add custom resources such as solutions with solution versions trained with recipes for custom use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Custom dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/custom-dataset-groups.html), where you create configurable resources for custom use cases and batch recommendation workflows. You choose a recipe, train a solution version (model), and deploy the solution version with a campaign. You use a campaign in your application to get recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a Custom dataset group if you don't have a video on demand or e-commerce application or want to configure and manage only custom resources, or want to get recommendations in a batch workflow. If you start with a Custom dataset group, you can't associate it with a domain later. Instead, create a new Domain dataset group.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create and manage Domain dataset groups and Custom dataset groups with the AWS console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or programmatically with the AWS SDKs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define your Use Case <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"usecase\"></a>\n",
    "[Back to top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few guidelines for scoping a problem suitable for Personalize. We recommend the values below as a starting point, although the [official limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/limits.html) lie a little lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authenticated users\n",
    "* At least 50 unique users\n",
    "* At least 100 unique items\n",
    "* At least 2 dozen interactions for each user \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time this is easily attainable, and if you are low in one category, you can often make up for it by having a larger number in another category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user-item-iteraction data is key for getting started with the service. This means we need to look for use cases that generate that kind of data, a few common examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Video-on-demand applications\n",
    "1. E-commerce platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining your use-case will inform what data and what type of data you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we are going to be creating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Amazon Personalize ECOMMERCE Domain recommender for the [\"Frequently bought together\"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/ECOMMERCE-use-cases.html#frequently-bought-together-use-case) use case.\n",
    "1. Amazon Personalize ECOMMERCE Domain recommender for the [\"Recommended for you\"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/ECOMMERCE-use-cases.html#recommended-for-you-use-case) use case.\n",
    "1. Amazon Personalize Custom Campaign for a personalized ranked list of items, for instance shelf/rail/carousel based on some information (category, colour, style etc...) \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these will be created within the same dataset group and with the same input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram bellow shows an overview of what we will be building in this wokshop.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Choose a Dataset or Data Source <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"source\"></a>\n",
    "[Back to top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the use case, the algorithms all share a base of learning on user-item-interaction data which is defined by 3 core attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **ItemID** - The item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. **Timestamp** - The time at which the interaction occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking your data will not arrive in a perfect form for Personalize, and will take some modification to be structured correctly. This notebook looks to guide you through all of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Personalize has certain required fieds and reserved keywords, and you need to format your data to meet these requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Correctly formated data will allow you to work with filters as well as supporting the [Recommended for you](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/ECOMMERCE-use-cases.html#recommended-for-you-use-case) Domain Recommender, and complying with the [ECOMMERCE domain dataset and schema requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/ECOMMERCE-datasets-and-schemas.html#ECOMMERCE-dataset-requirements)."

Note too that `CATEGORY_L1`, `CATEGORY_L2`, and `GENDER` are annotated as being categorical (`\"categorical\": true`). This tells Personalize to interpret the column value for each row as one or more categorical values where the `|` character can be used to separate values. For example, `value1|value2|value3`. The `PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION` column is annotated as being a text column (`\"textual\": true`). This tells Personalize that this column contains unstructured text. A natural language processing (NLP) model is used to extract features from the textual column to use as features in the model. Including a textual column in your items dataset can significantly enhance the relevancy of recommendations. Currently only one textual column can be included in the items dataset and the text must be in English.
